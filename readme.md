# Country populations by year

- Simple app that consumes an API (https://countriesnow.space/api/v0.1/countries/population) and generates graphs of country populations by year using Plotly and Dash.
- No frameworks used (the exception being Dash for the visualization).
- Uses concepts such as: dataclasses, generators, async API calls, context managers, typing.
- SQLite and Pandas are used to store and manipulate the data.
- Possible next steps: improve error handling; add unit tests.
